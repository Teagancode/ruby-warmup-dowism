This warmup is for use after introToHashes.rb

I want you to make an object(a hash) that lists what training you do each day of the week. Mine would look like this

training = {
  monday: "weight lifting after school",
  tuesday: ["short nordic ski","weightlifting"],
  wednesday: "long nordic in the morning",
  thursday: "Short nordic ski",
  friday: "Free ski or nordic after school depending on conditions",
  saturday:["kayak if possible","Backcountry","nordic","Workout"]
